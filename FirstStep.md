## Steps to setup Windows Desktop

- [Install Go] (https://golang.org/)
- [Go through the Git tutorials, if needed] (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/)
- [Create a GitHub account] (https://github.com/)
- [Let Suneel/Yutaka know your GitHub account username so that they can add you to the OmniTier GitHub organization.]
- [Install the GitHub Desktop application] (https://desktop.github.com/) 
and link to your GitHub account if it doesn't happen automatically.  This should also install the GitShell application automatically.
- [Install Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Clone the Skyriver repository (or a different OmniTier repository, as appropriate).  Make sure that the file structure matches something like this, it will keep you from having problems later.  GoWorkspace would be the Go Path that you should have set up already when installing Go: C:\GoWorkspace\src\github.com\Omnitier\skyriver\
